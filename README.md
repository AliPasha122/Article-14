Mold growth in residential buildings is a persistent global challenge, particularly in humid
environments. Despite advancements in construction materials and climate control
technologies, current solutions are either cost-prohibitive, energy-intensive, or ineffective in
the long term. This article proposes an innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable mold
prevention system using nanostructured hydrophobic coatings, smart ventilation systems,
and bio-based antifungal agents.
